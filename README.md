K-Means Clustering algorithmincludes basic functions for understanding the code
This is the Python code for the K-Means Clustering algorithm, which reads a text file named 'points' from my Google Drive. This K-Means algorithm includes basic functions for understanding the code, and it does not use any Python libraries. My challenge is that the address is correct, and the code runs without errors, but it does not produce any output. I have mounted my drive, and the address is accurate.
